# mikroC PRO for PIC Applications with PROTEUS
 This repository includes a wide range of "mikroC for 8-bit PIC" applications applied with PROTEUS circuit designs.
 
 In this example shown below, it is seen how to install a complex application made with a PIC microcontroller on the circuit board.

Port multiplexing is an important case in microcontroller circuit design. In some cases, a lot of work has to be done with a microcontroller with a small number of ports. In the example below, a multi-communication application example is shown with the MCP23S17 port expansion IC, which communicates with the PIC12F1840 via SPI serial communication protocol. Shortly, there are numerous and in a very wide range PIC circuit examples and applications in this repository.
